# This repository contains scripts and result files related to our AI-based stock prediction analysis for 2019 and 2020.

# "Prediction_2019.py" and "Prediction_2020.py" are the initial scripts used to generate the performance scores.
# The input datasets are not included in the repository due to Refinitiv Eikon's data-sharing restrictions, as the data is intended strictly for personal use.
# However, we have included all necessary financial metrics in the appendix so that users can independently gather the data and rerun the scripts.
# The scripts themselves remain fully functional and will yield the same output when run with equivalent input data.

# "OLS_regression_AI_2019_2020.xlsx" and "OLS_regression_Realized_2019_2020.xlsx" contain the datasets used for performing the OLS regressions.
# The OLS regression results are already embedded in the Excel files.
# The associated Python script, "OLS Regression Script & Heteroskedasticity.py", is available in the repository.
# To replicate the analysis, download the dataset, place it in your local Python directory, and ensure the correct file path is assigned in the script.

# "Fama_French_AI_2019_2020.xlsx" and "Fama_French_Realized_2019_2020.xlsx" are used for Fama-French five-factor regression.
# This was conducted using Excel’s built-in Data Analysis → Regression tool, and the results are included in the same Excel files.
# While the analysis can be re-run, all outputs are provided for convenience.

# This repository also includes stock price data added after the predicted scores were obtained, which can be found in the Excel file "Data_2019_2020.xlsx".

# To ensure transparency, each script is thoroughly documented with clear, step-by-step explanations of what is being done and why.
# This enables readers to fully understand the methodology and form their own judgments about the results.

# Note: The AI prediction scripts require an OpenAI API key, which involves usage credits.
