# "Prediction_2019.py" and "Prediction_2020.py" is the intial predicting script that got us the assigned performance score. The input dataset has not been included in the GitHub due to concerns regarding Eikons guidline of sharing data to others since its only supposed to be used for personal use. However, we have included the metrics needed in order to perform the same prediciton as we have done. This requires the user to gather the data on their own. But the script will still work the same way regardless. 

# "OLS_regression_AI_2019_2020.xlsx" and "OLS_regression_Realized_2019_2020.xlsx" is the dataset used for peforming the OLS regression, and the OLS results is posted within the Excel file. The OLS script is located in the repository under the namne "

# In this repository, you will find all the scripts and output Excel files from the predictive script. Including stock prices added after obtaining the predicted score. 
# We have chosen not to include the initial dataset due to issues that may arise with the Eikon Database privacy concerns. We would rather not take any chances, as the organization has stated that it's for individual use and not to be shared externally. 
# However, we have included detailed steps in the script for each code written, so the reader can easily get an overview of what is done and why it's done
# This ensures transparency and allows readers to form opinions on our findings.

# The AI performance prediction script can not be run without an API key, so it requires credits on the OpenAI platform.
# All other scripts are functioning and can be run with the same financial metrics that are listed in the appendix.
